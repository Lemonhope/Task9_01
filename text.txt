Whenever a new application pool is created, the IIS management process creates a security identifier (SID) that represents the name of the application pool itself.
For example, if you create an application pool with the name "MyNewAppPool," a security identifier with the name "MyNewAppPool" is created in the Windows Security system.
From this point on, resources can be secured by using this identity. However, the identity is not a real user account;
it will not show up as a user in the Windows User Management Console.

You can try this by selecting a file in Windows Explorer and adding the "DefaultAppPool" identity to the file's Access Control List (ACL).
Open Windows Explorer

- Select a file or directory.
- Right click the file and select Properties
- Select the Security tab
- Click the Edit button and then Add button
- Click the Locations button and make sure that you select your computer.
- Enter IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool in the Enter the object names to select: text box.
- Click the Check Names button and click on OK.
